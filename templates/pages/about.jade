          p Officina Creative Inc is a graphic design studio specializing in packaging design and branding for start-up and established companies &amp; brands. Our focus is in beauty and fashion, but we work with a wide range of clients. After freelancing for 3 years under her own name as a Graphic Designer and Art Director, Aprile Elcich decided to launch her business officially as Officina Creative, and to collaborate more with other designers, studios &amp; developers.
